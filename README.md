# ext-makefile does all of the following things:

+ Quickly creates an HTML document with sourced links to ExtJS JavaScript and CSS files (currently supports versions 4, 5 and 6).

+ Optionally downloads a Sencha Fiddle[fiddle] and inserts it into the new HTML document.

+ Brews a poor cup of coffee.
